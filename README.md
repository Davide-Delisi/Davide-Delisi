Hello, my name is DAVIDE DELISI

I am a Ph.D student ready to dig deep into the world of data science and bioinformatics as I am a true believer that the more science you know
the better you could potentially help more and more people

my project involves the role of potassium channels in cancer. 

Potassium channels have been shown to be a novel target for targeting specifically only cancer cells and not normal cells 
because most normal cells don’t express ion channels. Expression of these channels have shown to give a selective advantage to the survival of the channel therefore targeting these channels seems like the logical solution.


I just started really getting to learn how to code (python) and how to use this tool to start many projects relating to targeted oncological therapy.

ideas in projects involve:
1. what are the potassium channels that are involved in different types of cancer? This allows us to understand if certain potassium channels are involved in cancer 
    my goal is to ultimately do a meta analysis of all the potassium channels that are differentially expressed in cancer compared to normal tissue
    and associate an already FDA approved drug if possible to reverse the expression levels

2. understand if potassium channels are associated with chemotherapy resistance and if so could we target these potassium channels in combination with another drug to eliminate the cancer 

3. Killer t cells express potassium channels however it has been shown that it can give them more potential to proliferate or be more effective in killing the cancer
